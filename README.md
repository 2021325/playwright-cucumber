## [Documentation](https://playwright.dev) | [API reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright)

Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is **ever-green**, **capable**, **reliable** and **fast**.

## Writing Tests
Feature Files
Feature files are written in Gherkin syntax and located in the src/test/features/ directory. Example

Feature: Example feature

  Scenario: Example scenario
    Given I open the homepage
    When I click on the login button
    Then I should see the login form

Step Definitions
Step definitions are located in the src/test/steps/ directory. Example:

import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber';
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { Page } from 'playwright';

let page: Page;

Given('I open the homepage', async function () {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
});

When('I click on the login button', async function () {
  await page.click('#login');
});

Then('I should see the login form', async function () {
  const loginForm = await page.$('#login-form');
  expect(loginForm).not.toBeNull();
});

Configuration
Playwright Configuration
The playwright.config.ts file contains configuration for Playwright. Example:

import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  use: {
    headless: true,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
  },
};

export default config;

NPM Scripts
The following npm scripts are available for running and managing tests:

npm test: Runs all tests using Playwright.
npm run show-report: Generates and opens the HTML report after tests are executed.
npm run test:ci: Runs tests in headless mode for CI/CD environments.
To add these scripts to your package.json, include the following:

```Typescript
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npx playwright test",
    "show-report": "npx playwright show-report",
    "test:ci": "npx playwright test --ci"
  }
}
```
